# xplor-iOS-challenge
iOS challenge for interviewing candidates

## This challenge will touch on the following concepts
* SwiftUI
* State Manegment 
* MVVM Architecture
* Json Serialization
* Protocol / Delegate Workflows
* Closures
* Unit Testing

## App Description 
The app contains a view template that should be completed based off the mock screen provided below. This view is only meant to be a visual aid. Candidates may add their own style and look. But the layout of each component should mimic the example

<img src="example.png" alt="isolated" width="200"/>


Each view is meant to demonstrate different levels SwiftUI experience (NOTE: There is no UIKit challenges in this project).
1. Basic Level - Cell view with text and interactable button
2. Intermediate - Full view layout with header
3. Advanced - Fully functional tab bar view

NOTE: these should be completed in order and only pass the basic level if time permites. This challenge should not exceed 1 hour in time, however it is not expected for candidates to complete all challenges presented. 

Once SwiftUI skills are shown, candidates should proceed to the next set of challenges. 

## Challenges included
- Fix broken `JsonModel` and successfully parse provide json files.
- Parse and return json via a closure.
- Parse and return json via a delegate method.
- Update UI based on both scenarios above (Closure/Delegate returns).
- Create a unit test for either of the two parsing methods.
